### Abstract
An important part of our information-gathering has always been to find out what other people think. In the early times we got this information from our family, relatives, friends. Today the online social media is expanding beyond all rational measure so has the need to collect information. Millions of people are expressing their opinions online on e-commerce webistes, blogs and these have given rise to new opportunies and challenges to how poeple can use this information to understand the opinions of others. The tremendous increase in sentiment analysis and opinion mining in the recent year is the result of the need to computationally determine the opinion, sentiment and subjectivity in text. 

This project focuses on the sentiment analysis of **Devnagari** script which is used to write the **Hindi** language.
